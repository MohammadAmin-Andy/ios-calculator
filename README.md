# iOS Calculator Clone for Android (WIP)

🚧 **Project Status: In Development – Not yet completed or released** 🚧

This project is an attempt to **recreate the iOS default calculator app** for Android devices.  
It is **not a simple copy**, but a careful clone that aims to **mimic the UI and behavior of the iOS calculator**, adapted for the Android platform.

- 🔄 Full landscape mode support
- 🔄 Animations and haptic feedback similar to iOS
- 🔄 Full UX polish to feel exactly like the iOS experience
- 🔄 Correct spacing between numbers and operators (e.g., `12 + 13` instead of `12+13`)
- 🔄 Fix symbol display for multiplication/division (currently showing `*` and `/`)
- 🔄 Remove unnecessary trailing zeroes (e.g., show `45` instead of `45.000000`)
- 🔄 Prevent text overflow on large numbers (auto font scaling)
- 🔄 Limit max digits in input (e.g., 12 digits)
- 🔄 Show alert for unimplemented scientific/pro features
- 🔄 Make `+/-` toggle button functional
